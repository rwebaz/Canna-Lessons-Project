# Organic Seaweed

Organic Wild Seaweed Grown in The Mountains and Valleys of Beautiful British Columbia Tests ND.

## Testing ND

Most physicians will have a legitimate concern for their patients who vape.

## Not Detectable

Rings up pure when tested across the board for pathogens, pesticides, and additives.
