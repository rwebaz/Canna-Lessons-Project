## The Causes That Impel

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

And, to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such separation."

## Epidemic

Today in America, 50 million Americans ( with the tacit support of their representatives in Congress ) use both prescription and black-market opioids, sedatives, and stimulants for "non-medical" or recreational usage.

**Rule**. For the love of money and power, your government is out to make you sick and sicker!

## Death

Around 20,000 persons per year, about the same size crowd for a well publicized, traditional soccer match in the USA will decorate their death certificates with the word "overdose" from the extra use of legal and non-legal prescription and black-market opioids, sedatives, and stimulants.

Another 40,000 will croak simply by using the #BigPharma concoctions per label instructions!

## Contrast and Compare

To contrast and compare, approximately 18 million Americans suffer from chronic Alcohol abuse and dependency with approximately 88,000 of those "drunks" dying each year as a result of their alcohol induced mental, social, and physical maladies.

**Note.** Even President Trump lost his older brother Fred, Jr. to the wasting away effects of alcohol induced death.

## Promote Homeostasis

Short-term, the one all encompassing or universal side effect of imbibing Cannabis products for simple awareness and homeostatic wellness is sleepiness.

Most people who suffer from repeated bouts of insomnia say this anecdotal fact is a real godsend.

Though as in any population large enough to glean correlation, there will be a few subjects for whom the sleepy effect of Cannabis does not apply.

On the obverse, over the long-term, repeated daily use of Cannabis may lead to lethargy.

Where on that continuum or "golden mean" between lethargy, sleepiness, and no effect you may fall depends a lot upon the genetic and epigenetic composition of your life experiences.

And, that Includes birth and the preceding dance of meiosis between your parents' gametes.

Most subjects, however, fall within the middle bands of tolerance and will simply experience "sleepiness".

A few will find themselves at the extremes of "no effect" and a few will become "lethargic".

So, how do we prevent the few from falling into lethargy?

Abstinence is one possibility, but everyone needs and uses cannabinoids do they not?

Either endo or phyto, the usage of cannabinoids is hard-wired into our genome.

How 'bout we just catch and not release all of the cannabis users in America and world-wide?

No, we tried that.

It didn't work and most observers say the tactics used were purely racist at heart.

## Chronic Pain

Another 100 million Americans report ongoing chronic pain to their physicians.

How much of that is real, and how much is memorex?
