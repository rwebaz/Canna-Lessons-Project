## Improve Dat Yield

To *scrog* is to screen the tops of your Cannabis trees.

This allows the footprint of the above LED to hit the maximum space with streams of carbon constructing photons.

Thus in the process of construction, the plants will synthesize energy packs of sugars for usage and storage deep within the cellular structure of the plant.

From the now sound structure of the plant will emanate bio pathways that further create exotic substances for defense, and for attraction.

## Choose Wisely

The developed *scrogging* method used by medicinal Cannabis growers can also be used on other less socially unacceptable plants, such as tomatoes.

Though at first discovery, a member of the nightshade family that includes eggplant, the Caribbean tomato was thought to be poisonous in the west, as well.
