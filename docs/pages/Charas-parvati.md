No words can describe the intense happiness I felt that moment finding myself locked in a personal center of the universe flying free as a bird gliding through creation and the colorful swirls of my mind.

But, there I was, listening to the wind playing with the leaves and recognizing the magical sound of countless exotic birds singing to me in the most beautiful cacophony of Mother Nature ever recorded.

I have been searching for that same bliss ever since then and today that feeling is within our grasp once again.

In the year #2007, an even more potent source of Charas genetics was found!
