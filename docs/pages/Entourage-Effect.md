## Terpenes

**Terpenes** play more than an aromatic roll when combined with phyto-cannabinoids.

### Pinene

**Pinene** is commonly associated with the smell of pine needles or rosemary bushes, as well as dill, basil, and hops, and comes in two types of slightly different smelling isomers, a ( alpha-pinene ) and b ( beta-pinene ).

#### a-Pinene

**Alpha Pinene** anecdotally and in the laboratory has certain medicinal properties, namely:

- reduces inflammation

- combats cancer

- kills bacteria on contact

- improved respiratory function

- improved brain function

#### b-Pinene

Whereas, **Beta Pinene** has been shown to be anti-psychotic to the patient while at the same time boosting the ability of your short-term memory apparatus ie.) the Hippocampus to store long-term memories.

### Linalool

The best way to describe the terpene **Linalool** is to remember the smell of Lavender flowers.

**Lavender** has been shown anecdotally and in the laboratory by perfume experts to be one of the Top five (5) scents that women crave the most.

The others being fresh cucumbers, black licorice, baby powder, and pumpkin pie spice.

( Sorry guys, but the scent of Bar-B-Que and Buttered Popcorn both worked as agonists against the physiological symptoms measured when testing subjects that were of the female of the species. )

**Note**. The spice known as **Coriander** also has a high content of **Linalool**, as well.

### Myrcene

The terpene **Myrcene** is the most commonly synthesized terpenoid in the Cannabis plant worldwide.

Think of the spice called **Clove** and you will easily smell the terpene **Myrcene**.

The word clove is derived from the Spanish word for "nail" because of the small, dried flower tips and stems that contain the essential aromatic oils, and look like little "nails" ready to be hammered into wood ...!

Commonly referred to as "Couch-lock" dweeb, Cannabis with concentrations of 50% or more of its Terpene content locked in **Myrcene** will "hammer" the medical patient into the sofa.

**Myrcene** anecdotally and in the laboratory also has certain medicinal properties, namely:

- relieves insomnia

- combats cancer

- scours the blood for free radicals

- improves brain function

**Note**. **Myrcene** is also found in high concentrations in the Mango plant, as well. So, eat a mango before bed at night ( along with your favorite vaporization ) to enhance the **Entourage Effect**.
